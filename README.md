## Cloud UI Take Home Exercise

As the next step in the interview process, weâ€™d like you to complete a take home exercise.

The task is to create a UI presenting the data in the provided JSON in a clear and intuitive manner that allows a user to see everything that is relevant to them, but without overwhelming them either.

Let's assume `deployment.json` is the API response you want to present to the user of a cloud service.
A deployment is one or more products from the Elastic Stack configured to work together, each one in its own node.
Determine what information would be important for the user and display it in one or two pages.

You can use this project to set up the environment quickly.
Feel free to add what you feel is necessary but please don't spend more than 2 - 3 hours.

You can install the project with

```
yarn
```

and start it with

```
yarn start
```

## About this repo

This app uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and was generated using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This is meant to give you a head start so you don't have to worry about app setup. We leveraged [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) so you can easily setup additional routes if you'd like. Feel free to do what you wish with the code from here!

We've also included the [Elastic UI Framework](https://github.com/elastic/eui) (EUI) for you to use.  The [EUI living style guide](https://elastic.github.io/eui/#/) provides plenty of examples for you to reference.
