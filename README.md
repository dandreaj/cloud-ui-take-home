## Cloud UI Take Home Exercise

As the next step in the interview process, we’d like you to complete a take home exercise.

The task is to create a UI presenting the data in the provided JSON in a clear and intuitive manner that allows a user to see everything that is relevant to them, but without overwhelming them either.

Let's assume `deployment.json` is the API response you want to present to the user of a cloud service.
A deployment is one or more products from the Elastic Stack configured to work together, each one in its own node.
Determine what information would be important for the user and display it in one or two pages.
If the cluster is unhealthy the user wants to see some information on the plan.
Show the important information in one or two pages.

You can use this project to set up the environment quickly.
Feel free to add what you feel is necessary but please don't spend more than 2 - 3 hour.

You can install the project with

```
yarn
```

and start it with

```
yarn start
```
